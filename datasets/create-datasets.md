# Create Datasets

### Overview

The "Create New Dataset" page on the Cluster Protocol AI platform provides users with a streamlined form to create and upload new datasets. This functionality is essential for contributing to the community's growing repository of datasets, enabling collaboration and innovation across various AI and machine learning projects.

#### Key Features

* Dataset: A user-friendly form that allows users to input essential details about their dataset.
* Field Options: Users can specify the name, visibility, modalities, and formats of the dataset.

### Form Fields Description

#### 1. Name

* Purpose: Enter the name of the dataset.
* Importance: A clear and descriptive name helps others understand the dataset's content and purpose.

#### 2. Visibility

* Options: Public or Private.
* Purpose: Determine who can access the dataset.
  * Public: Available to everyone on the platform.
  * Private: Restricted to specific users or groups.

#### 3. Modalities

Users can select one or more modalities to describe the type of data contained within the dataset:

* 3D: Datasets containing three-dimensional data, often used in computer graphics, simulations, and augmented reality applications.
* Audio: Sound-based datasets, useful for speech recognition, music analysis, and other auditory applications.
* Geospatial: Data related to geographic locations, crucial for mapping, geographic information systems (GIS), and location-based services.
* Image: Collections of images used in computer vision tasks such as object detection, image classification, and facial recognition.
* Tabular: Structured data in tables, commonly used for statistical analysis and machine learning tasks involving structured input.
* Text: Textual data, suitable for natural language processing tasks like sentiment analysis, translation, and text generation.
* Time-series: Sequences of data points collected over time, applicable in financial forecasting, sensor data analysis, and more.
* Video: Moving image data, employed in video analysis, surveillance, and multimedia applications.

#### 4. Formats

Select the format(s) in which the dataset is available:

* JSON: A lightweight data-interchange format that is easy to read and write for humans and machines.
* CSV: Comma-separated values format, widely used for tabular data and compatible with many data analysis tools.
* Parquet: A columnar storage file format optimized for use with big data processing frameworks.
* Image Folder: A directory containing images, often used in datasets for image classification tasks.
* Sound Folder: A directory containing audio files, useful for datasets focused on audio analysis.
* WebDataset: A format designed for efficient loading of large datasets over the web, often used in distributed computing environments.
* Text: Plain text files, typically used for datasets involving raw textual data.
* Arrow: A cross-language development platform for in-memory data, optimized for analytics and data science workflows.

### Creating a New Dataset

To create a new dataset on the Cluster Protocol AI platform, follow these steps:

1. Access the Dataset Creation Page: Navigate to the [Create New Dataset](https://beta.clusterprotocol.ai/datasets/new) page.
2. Fill Out the Form:
   * Enter the Name of your dataset.
   * Set the Visibility to either Public or Private.
   * Select the appropriate Modalities by choosing from the list provided.
   * Choose the Formats your dataset is available in by selecting the relevant options.
3. Submit the Form: Once all fields are completed, submit the form to create your dataset.

By following these instructions, you can effectively contribute your dataset to the Cluster Protocol AI platform, making it accessible for others in the AI community to use and build upon.
