## How to Use the Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct Playground

The Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct playground allows users to interact with the Meta-Llama-3-8B model by providing input parameters and generating responses based on the model's capabilities. Here's a guide on how to use the Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct playground using the specified parameters:

### Input Parameters:

1. Your Prompt:
   * Type: String
   * Description: Enter the prompt or question you want to provide to the Meta-Llama-3-8B model.
   * Default Value: Johnny has 8 billion parameters. His friend Tommy has 70 billion parameters. What does this mean when it comes to speed?"
   * Required: Yes
2. System Prompt:
   * Type: String
   * Description: Optionally provide a system prompt for the model.
   * Default Value: "You are a helpful assistant"
   * Required: No
3. Max Tokens:
   * Type: Integer
   * Description: Set the maximum number of tokens for the model to generate in response.
   * Range: 1 to 1000
   * Default Value: 256
4. Min Tokens:
   * Type: Integer
   * Description: Set the minimum number of tokens for the model to generate in response.
   * Range: 1 to 1000
   * Default Value: 50
5. Temperature:
   * Type: Number
   * Description: Adjust the temperature parameter for controlling the randomness of the generated text.
   * Range: 0 to 5
   * Default Value: 0.7
6. Top P:
   * Type: Number
   * Description: Set the top-p parameter for nucleus sampling.
   * Range: 0 to 1
   * Default Value: 0.95
7. Top K:
   * Type: Integer
   * Description: Set the top-k parameter for top-k sampling.
   * Range: -1 to 1000
   * Default Value: -1
8. Stop Sequences:
   * Type: String
   * Description: Specify stop sequences to indicate the end of text generation.
   * Default Value: "<|end\_of\_text|>,<|eot\_id|>"

### Using the Playground:

1. Input Your Prompt: Enter your desired prompt or question in the "Your Prompt" field. This will serve as the input for the Meta-Llama-3-8B model.
2. Adjust Parameters: Optionally adjust the other parameters such as Max Tokens, Min Tokens, Temperature, Top P, Top K, and Stop Sequences based on your requirements.
3. Generate Response: Click on the "Generate Response" button to let the Meta-Llama-3-8B model process your input and generate a response based on the provided parameters.
4. View Output: Once the model generates a response, you can view the output text in the playground interface to see the AI-generated content based on your input.

By following these steps and customizing the input parameters, users can effectively utilize the Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct playground to interact with the Meta-Llama-3-8B model and explore its capabilities.
